## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

This will include both the code and its result into the created document.  
Clicking the tiny green arrow in the top right corner of the chunk will execute only that chunk, within RStudio.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

## Load the data

Run this chunk to download the data and load it into your R session.

```{r}
protein_data <- read.table(file = "https://git.io/fjfMC",
                        header = TRUE,
                        sep = ";",
                        dec = ",",
                        as.is = c(1, 2, 3, 21))
```

## The assignments 

#### Assignment 1

You have seen the function `table()` which can be used to create a frequency table. Apply this function to generate a table for the different localizations as identified by LipoP.

```{r}
table(protein_data$LipoP_Localisation)
```

#### Assignment 2

Use `table()` again, this time to create a "contingency table" (cross tabulation) for LipoP localization agains SignalP predictions (Yes/No). Is there a (cor)relation between these analyses?

```{r}
table(protein_data$LipoP_Localisation, protein_data$SignalP_YesNo)
```

#### Assignment 2

First run the chunk below to get a new column for the TMHMM analysis, giving a simplified version of column `TMHMM_PredHel`. If the number of transmembrane helices is bigger then 1, it is reduced to "2+"

```{r}
protein_data$TMHMM_PredHelSimple <- protein_data$TMHMM_PredHel
protein_data$TMHMM_PredHelSimple <- ifelse(protein_data$TMHMM_PredHel > 1, "2+", protein_data$TMHMM_PredHel)
#protein_data$TMHMM_PredHelSimple 
```

Now create a "contingency table" for SignalP against TMHMM_PredHelSimple predictions. Is there a (cor)relation between these analyses? What does this say?

```{r}
table(protein_data$SignalP_YesNo, protein_data$TMHMM_PredHelSimple)
```
